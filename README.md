# OOPAssignment
I have chosen to complete the My Search Engine assignment. Inside WordSearcher class, are a couple of methods which will perform different tasks. From within main() a method called GUISetup() will be run, here is where all the GUI components are setup such as the JLabel, JButton and JTextField. These are positioned within the frame using the setBounds() method. Once the user enters a word to be searched the actionPerformed() method gets run. Inside here is where we will begin to search for the word through the different text files. An if Statement will check to see if the user’s word is valid, for example if it is not a numeric value. If the user inputs an invalid word, a message in red will appear to prompt them to re-enter a valid usable word. A for loop is created to look into the directory of the files and individually read them, this is done using a scanner, bufferedReader and fileReader. This part of the code is surrounded by a try catch statement just in case the directory is invalid. The user’s word is then compared, and a counter is used to note the amount of appearances in each file. Finally, a combination of if Statements are used to calculate the strongest match and the file with the most word appearances is returned at the top of the list.
